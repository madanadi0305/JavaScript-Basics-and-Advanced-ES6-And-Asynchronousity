# Exercise 26

Open file named **task26.js** and write a Javascript program that contains a function named **copy** which reads the contents from **"file1.txt"** and copies the content of that file into a new file named **"file2.txt"**. After the task is completed, return `"file created"`. Both the files will be from the root directory.

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = {
Â  content: copy
};
```

Hints:

- Create a function that reads from a file.
- Create another function which writes into a file.
- Create a third function which copies the content from the given file into another file.
