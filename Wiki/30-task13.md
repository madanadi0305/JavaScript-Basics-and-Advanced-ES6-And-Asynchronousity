# Exercise 13


Open file named **task13.js** and write a javascript program that returns the string passed converted into upperstring through promise after some delay if there is no error. which contains a function named **'up'**. This function waits for 0.5 seconds, and its operations are wrapped inside a promise. The function takes two arguments: **(a, error)** where 'a' is a string and 'error' is boolean. The function resolves the promise returning 'a' converted into uppercase if the boolean argument passed is false. Else, it rejects the promise with the message: "Error occured!".
Use this function, passing argument ("hello world!", false) to print "HELLO WORLD!" using then().

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = { up: up };
```
