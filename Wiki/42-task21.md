# Exercise 21

Open file named **task21.js** and write a JS program that has a function that takes a number as argument
 and returns two times the number after a delay of two seconds. 
 Call the above function using another function named `addAsync` three times 
 with different arguments and return their sum.

Hints:

- Create a function with one input parameter that creates a delay of 2 seconds and
 return the double of the given number.
- Create another async function with three input parameters that calls the
 above function three times for all three input parameters then, adds their results and return it.

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = {
Â  sum: addAsync
};
```
