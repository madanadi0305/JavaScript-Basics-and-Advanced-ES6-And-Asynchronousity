# Exercise 4

Write a js program that returns sum or difference according to the user need through a callback.

Create a javascript program, which contains three functions: add, sub, and calc.
The add function takes two integers: x and y as arguments and return their sum as a result.

The sub function takes two integers as arguments and return their difference (x-y) as result.

The calc function has three parameters: x, y, and a callback function. 
add function or sub function can be passed as arguments in the calc function through the callback parameter.
 The calc function returns the appropriate result according to the callback function.
For example, calc(10,15,add) will return 25 as output.

First, open file task04.js

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = {
  add: add,
  sub: sub,
  calc: calc
};
```
