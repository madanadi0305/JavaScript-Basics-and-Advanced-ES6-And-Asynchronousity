# Exercise 12

Open file named **task12.js** and write a javascript program that tells if there is an error or not through promise. 
which contains a function named **erro**. 
This function waits for 1 second, and its operations are wrapped inside a promise, 
and it takes one boolean argument - error.
 The function resolves the promise returning "No error!" if the argument passed is false. 
 Else, it rejects the promise with the message: "Error occured!".
Use this function, passing argument false to print "No error!" using then().

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = { erro: erro };
```
