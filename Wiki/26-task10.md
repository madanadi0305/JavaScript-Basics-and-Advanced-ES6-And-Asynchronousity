# Exercise 10

Open file named task10.js and write a javascript program that returns YES if the number is positive, else NO.
 It contains a function named bina. 
 This function's operations are wrapped inside a promise, 
 and it takes one argument - x i.e, an integer. 
 The function resolves the promise, returning "YES" if the argument passed is positive. 
 Else, it rejects the promise with the message: "NO".
Use this function, passing argument 1 to print YES using then().

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
Â  bina: bina
};
```
