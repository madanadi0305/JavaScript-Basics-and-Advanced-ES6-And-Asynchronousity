# Exercise 29

Open file named **task29.js** and Write a Program to illustrate the use of generator function by yielding 
the following statements :

- 'Hello World!!!'
- 'This is an example of a generator'
- 'Here we use the yield keyword for creating a stopping point'
- 'And we move from one stopping point to other by using .next()'
- 'We can get the value by appending .value after .next()'
- 'Also look at the done value - it stays false until there is no stopping point '

Generator Syntax :

```js
function* functionname() {
  // Statements
  yield "Statements";
  return "message"; // optional (Check usage of it in Generator content)
}
```

and also return the following message inside your generator function:

- 'Also in the last, we can use the return keyword if we want'

Note:

- Every next yield expression gets executed only when the compiler finds .next() command.

- Export your generator function as an object with property name :
  **"generatorFn"**.

Hints:

- Create a generator function
- write yield statements inside the generator function
- call generator function
- Print the yield statements using the next method on generator function
- Export your generator function as an object with key-value : "generatorFn".
