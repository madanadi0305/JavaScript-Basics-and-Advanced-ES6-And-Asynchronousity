# Exercise 14

Open file named **task14.js** and write a javascript program that inserts elements of one array into another through promise after some delay. that contains two arrays: **ar1 & ar2** and one function: **arrpush**.

- ar1 has value `[1,2,3,4]`
- ar2 has value `[0]`

`arrpush` function takes two arrays as arguments: arr1 and arr2 and waits for 1 second. Its operations are wrapped inside a promise. The function pushes all the elements of arr1 into arr2 and resolves the promise returning arr2 if the length of arr2 is greater than 1. Else, it rejects the promise with the message: "Error!".

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
  ar1: ar1,
  ar2: ar2,
  arrpush: arrpush
};
```
