# Exercise 17

Open file named **task17.js** and write a javascript that requires the fs module. 
This program **writes** and **reads** data in a specified file and returns it as a string
using the fs module and promise.
contains two functions: **writeFile** and **readFile**. 

**readFile** function takes one string argument: (fname) i.e., the path of the file to read. 
The operations of this function are wrapped inside a promise which resolves and returns the data
 in the file passed as an argument if there is no error. Otherwise rejects it with a message "No file found".

**writeFile** function takes two string arguments: (fname, s). 
The operations of this function are also wrapped inside a promise. 
The function writes 's' in the file 'fname' and resolves with the message "Done!"
if there is no error otherwise rejects it if there is an error in writing the file with a message "Failed".

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
  readFile: readFile,
  writeFile: writeFile
};
```
