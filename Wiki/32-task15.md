# Exercise 15

Open file named **task15.js** and write a javascript program that adds elements to an array after 1000ms delay then prints all of the elements of the array after 500ms using promise.that  has an array of objects named **'posts'**. The objects in this array are in the following format: 

```js
{ title: 'Post one' , body:'This is post one' }
```

Your task is to add a new post to this array after waiting 1000ms and then print all the arrays after waiting 500ms using two functions named: **createPost** and **getPost**.
The createPost function waits for 1000ms and its operations are wrapped inside a promise. It adds another post passed as an argument to the posts array if there is no error and the promise is resolved. Otherwise, it rejects with a message "Error: Something went wrong". Assume there are no errors.
The getPost function simply prints all the posts inside the array after waiting 500ms(every post must be in newline).

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
  posts: posts,
  getPost: getPost,
  createPost: createPost
};
```
