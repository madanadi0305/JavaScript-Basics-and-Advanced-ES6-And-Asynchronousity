# Exercise 6

Write a JS program which filters array through a callback function that contains three functions filter5() and filter10() and filter.

- filter5() has one argument: array

- filter5 filters elements 5 from the array and returns the new list.

- filter10() has one argument: array

- filter10 filters elements 10 from the array and returns the new list.

- filter() has two arguments: array and a callback

- filter() returns the callback with array as an argument.

First, create a file task06.js

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = {
  ten: filter10,
  five: filter5,
  fil: filter
};
```
