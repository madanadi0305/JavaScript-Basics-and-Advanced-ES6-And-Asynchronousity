# Exercise 5


Write a javascript program which has an array of objects named 'posts'. The objects in this array are in the following format:

```js
{ title: 'Post one' , body:'This is post one' }
```

Your task is to add a new post to this array after waiting 2000ms and then print all the arrays after waiting 1000ms using two functions named : createPost and getPost.
The createPost function waits for 2000ms and then adds another post passed as argument to the posts array while the getPost function prints all the posts in the array in after 1000ms delay(every post must be in newline).

First open file task05.js

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = {
  posts: posts,
  createPost: createPost,
  getPost: getPost
};
```
