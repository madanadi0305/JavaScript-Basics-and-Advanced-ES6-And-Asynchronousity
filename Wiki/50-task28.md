# Exercise 28

Write a JS program 

Open file named **task28.js** and write a JS program that prints two messages with a delay of 1 second and 2 seconds
 concurrently using async-await. which conatins `4` async functions: 
 **timeout**, **resolveAfter1Second**, **resolveAfter2Second** and **concurrentStart**.

timeout takes 1 argument- a number which denotes how much time the function will wait in ms,
 and returns a promise with resolve message - "**x** ms timer finished",
  after waiting that time. Here, x denotes the ms value which is passed as an argument.

resolveAfter2Second prints "starting slow promise" through console.log() and returns timeout value when 2000 is passed 
as an argument. The resolveAfter1Second function prints "starting fast promise" through console.log() and returns timeout value when 1000 is passed as an argument.

These two functions are called by another async function named **concurrentStart** whose operations happen concurrently. 
This function prints "==CONCURRENT START with await==" and then calls resolveAfter2Second and resolveAfter1Second 
concurrently.
Then push both the promises in an array "promises" and resolve all the iterable promises in promise.all(promises)

 and return it.

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = concurrentStart;
```
