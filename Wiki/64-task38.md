# Exercise 38

Open file named **task38.js**. write a program to generate the Fibonacci series using the generator function and then 
filter elements of the Fibonacci series using the generator function.
Your task is to create a generator function that generates the Fibonacci series up to the value passed as 
an argument to the generator function.

- Create another generator function that will filter the even elements of the Fibonacci series i.e. 
replace the even elements in the Fibonacci series with '0'.
  This generator will take an array of Fibonacci series elements.

- Create a generator function that will use the first generator function that will return Fibonacci series 
elements, store them in an array and use other generator functions and pass that array to it and filter the elements.
  - try printing the updated elements.
- In a nutshell, this function will take a parameter that will be the maximum value that the Fibonacci series
 can have then, it will replace all even element from that series of array and **`yield`** the *resulting array*
  **after filtration**.

Note:

- Export your functions in the form of objects as shown :

```js
module.exports = {
  fibonacciFn: generator1,
  filterFn: generator2,
  checkFn: function3
};
```

Hints :

- Create a generator function to generate fibonacci series
- Use infinite loop
- use if condition check the maximum value of element if maximum value reached break loop.
- yield fibonacci element
- Create another generator function to filter the elements of the fibonacci series
- Create third function and use your generator functions inside it
- Use your generator function using while or for...of loop.
