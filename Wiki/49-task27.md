# Exercise 27

Open file named **task27.js** and write a JS program that prints two messages with a delay of 1 second and 2 seconds 
sequentially using async-await. 
which conatins `4` async functions: **timeout**, **resolveAfter1Second**, **resolveAfter2Second** and **sequentialStart**.

timeout takes 1 argument- a number which denotes how much time the function will wait in ms,
 and returns a promise with empty resolve after waiting that time.

resolveAfter1Second function returns "1 sec" after 1 second and resolveAfter2Second returns "2 sec" after 2 seconds
 using the timeout function.

These two functions are called by another async function (named sequentialStart) whose operations happen sequentially.
 This function returns an object with two keys: **slow** (contains the result of resolveAfter2Second) and 
 **fast** (contains the result of resolveAfter1Second).

Export your functions in given format:

```js
module.exports = sequentialStart;
```
