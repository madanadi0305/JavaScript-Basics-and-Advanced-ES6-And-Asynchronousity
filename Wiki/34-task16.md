# Exercise 16

Open file named **task16.js**. write a javascript which requires the fs module. This program reads data in a specified file and returns it as a string using the fs module and promise. It contains a function named **readFile** which takes one string argument: the path of the file to read. The operations of this function are wrapped inside a promise which resolves and returns the data in the file passed as an argument if there is no error. Otherwise rejects it with a message "No file found".
Use this function to read and print the contents of **"helper.txt"** using then().

Export using the following format:

```js
module.exports = {
Â  readFile: readFile
};
```
